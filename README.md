This is my dotfiles archive for my silly little yellow themed arch. I'm not deeply passionate about the yellow color but I only like the wallpaper that's in the `./wallpapers` folder so...

##  Shit to rice:

- [ ] zsh prompt, configuration of p10k
- [ ] nvim
- [ ] rofi (I have to re-learn CSS for fuck sake)
- [ ] major shell scripts that do my personal shit
- [ ] joshuto  
- [ ] write my own fetch
