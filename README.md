This is my dotfiles archive for my silly little yellow themed arch. I'm not deeply passionate about the yellow color but I only like the wallpaper that's in the `./wallpapers` folder so...

##  Shit to rice:

- [x] overall theme, it is kinda inconsistent rn (yellow too bright)
- [x] zsh prompt, configuration of p10k
- [ ] nvim
- [ ] rofi (I have to re-learn CSS for fuck sake)
- [ ] major shell scripts that do my personal shit
- [ ] joshuto  
- [x] ~~write my own fetch~~ yoinked the source from [here](https://github.com/13-CF/afetch.git) lmaooo
- [x] finish to configure `kitty.conf`
    - [x] fix conflicting colors (gray in the VCS status module of powerlevel10k and issue with `LS_COLORS` remap)   
        *   fixed commenting yellow and green colors in `Adapta.conf`      
    - [x] colorscheme
    - [x] active & non-active dims (maybe with `hyprland.conf`? I'll se the kitty-wiki...)
- [x] firefox custom `.css` I'm tired of all that bloat-UI up there, want a minimal interface maybe only the search bar
    - [ ] adjust colors in the `.css` files 
- [x] main aliases
- [ ] binds for volume and brightness

##  Notes / Updates

*   Upgraded to kitty, maintaining the terminator config just in case (they're the same with the maps too)
*   For the first time i mapped shutdown and reboot commands (better late than ever)
*   custom `.css` for firefox that I found was ugly as fuck, maintaining the stock theme for now
